    "# Short Intro to Boosting\n",
    "Boosting-type algorithms are based on **two core principles**:\n",
    "1. Develop an ensemble sequentially (i.e. add one model at a time)\n",
    "2. Let the next model in the chain correct the errors of the current ensemble\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed two flavors of boosting in the lecture:\n",
    "- **adaboost algorithm**, first instantiation of a boosting ensemble\n",
    "- **gradient boosting**, proposed in the paper [Greedy Function Approximation: A Gradient Boosting Machine](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2699986?seq=1) by Jerome H. Friedman\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the tutorial follows the same approach as above, we first demonstrate implementing a boosting ensemble from scratch and then showcase its use together with a professional machine learning library. Many derivatives of boosting and libraries exist. Some members of the gradient boosting family include:\n",
    "- [LightGBM from Microsoft](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "- [Catboost from Yandex](https://catboost.ai/)\n",
    "- [NGBoost from Stanford ML Group](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/ngboost/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given wide adoption in practice and academia, we opted for focusing the tutorial to **extreme gradient boosting** or XGB for short. Demos for other popular boosting algorithms are available via the links above. Boosting algorithms that do not follow the gradient boosting principle may be considered somewhat old-fashioned. We will not cover them here. However, the exercises give you an opportunity to implement your own Adaboost ensemble from scratch. And of course, `sklearn` also supports adaboost and other boosting algorithms.    "

    "## Gradient Boosting \n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting is one specific form of boosting (using residuals recursively to increase accuracy). This process begins with an initial simple prediction which is often the mean of the target variable. After, the algorithm iteratively goes through every feature and determines which feature will best reduce this error with a single split. This is essentially a single level tree, or stump. This stump is then chosen and added to the ensemble. Next, residuals are calculated once again and the process continues for as many iterations as deemed necessary.\n",

    "## XGBoost with xgb library \n",
    "Different gradient boosting algorithms exist and different implementations exist of each of those. If you want to use the *original gradient boosting machine* as proposed in [Friedman's 2001 paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2699986?seq=1) or his [follow-up paper on stochastic gradient boosting](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-9473(01)00065-2), we recommend using the class `sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier`. It offers a lot of flexibility (e.g., hyperparameters) and is[ very well documented](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html). However, for later data sets, you might want to use **extreme gradient boosting (XGB)**, which was explicitly designed for highly scalable gradient boosting. Below, we demonstrate application of XGB to our credit risk data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although `sklearn` does have a version of this algorithm, it is actually common to use the `xgboost` library for training XGB models. To be precise, `sklearn` offers an implementation of XGB but it might not incorporate the latest features. As far as the use is concerned, you will not notice any differences between the `xgboost` library and `sklearn`. However, **you might need to install the `xgboost` library before moving on**."

    "### Dataset and DataLoader Classes\n",
    "Code for processing data samples can get messy and hard to maintain; we ideally want our dataset code to be decoupled from our model training code for better readability and modularity. PyTorch provides two data primitives: torch.utils.data.DataLoader and torch.utils.data.Dataset that allow you to use pre-loaded datasets as well as your own data. Dataset stores the samples and their corresponding labels, and DataLoader wraps an iterable around the Dataset to enable easy access to the samples.\n",
